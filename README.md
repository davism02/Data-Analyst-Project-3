Background & General Info

Itâ€™s no secret that the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is deeply affecting the lives of millions around the world, both directly and indirectly. The United States alone has shed nearly 10 million jobs in the past two weeks due to the COVID-19 shutdown.

However, surveys indicate that the data teams are long yet to see widespread layoffs or furloughs at this time, particularly among larger companies. So, strike at the jobs while it lasts?

We have created a website that precisely helps people look for data analyst jobs nationwide. Our website lets users get whole picture of data analysts job openings nationwide, including size of employer, location, industry and estimated salary range.


## Data sources:
For our website, we used that data analyst job postings dataset from Kaggle, which contains data of salary estimate, location, company rating, job description and more for job in the United States. Our dataset had more than 2000 rows and 16 columns. While going through our data we were able to decide that we will do visualizations around job opening by location, employer's size and estimated range of salary.
